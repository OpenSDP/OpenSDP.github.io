## OpenSDP Website

This repository contains files for the [OpenSDP website](https://opensdp.github.io/).

## Contributing to the website

OpenSDP welcomes pull requests and updates to the website. To contribute an
edit to the page, fork the repository and submit a pull request.

The OpenSDP homepage is hosted on GitHub Pages using the `jekyll` static
site generator.

### Where to Find What To Edit

Content rendered on the website is stored in markdown text files with the
file extension `.md`. These files live in two folder:

- `domains` which contain the pages for the main topic headers
- `_subpages` which contain content to be displayed as subpages within some
of the main pages - particularly the *Analysis* and the *Data* pages

If you want to suggest style and layout edits you will need to edit the
html layouts in the `_layouts` subdirectory or the `css` content in the
`_sass` directory.

There are also some page components (headers, footers, and icons) that are
stored as html files in the `_includes` directory.
