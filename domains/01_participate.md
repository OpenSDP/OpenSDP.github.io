Currently, there is no easy way for analysts in one school system to leverage
analysts’ skills and knowledge in another state or district. Additionally,
education researchers are developing advanced methods and techniques to answer
important questions, but their code often remains locked in the ivory tower or
in think tanks.  Through an open community, we can begin to break down barriers
and democratize education data analysis. Here is how:


{% include link_box.html
  heading = "Join the Conversation"
  content = "OpenSDP is a community of education data analysts working together.
  Come join us in our Slack channel to find others tackling similar problems and
  connect with resources to help you with your challenges. Build great analytics
  together."
  started = "https://join.slack.com/t/opensdp/shared_invite/enQtNDUyMDEzNzYxODYzLTBjMzQ4ZWZlNTY4N2Y1YmFjNzY1OTdkOWVjOGYwYjAyMThhODkzYjBmYWM0MjA0MzQyNWE2Y2VkOTNiNTc0ZjM" %}


{% include link_box.html
  heading = "Contribute New Analyses"
  content = "SDP has a detailed contributor guide available on GitHub to help
  you get started building analyses of your own that you can share with the
  OpenSDP community."
  repository = "https://github.com/OpenSDP/OpenSDP_starter_pack"
  %}


{% include link_box.html heading = "Run Contributed Analyses" content = "Select
the repository of analysis that you want explore from our Analysis library.
Clone, download, or fork resources to your computer. Then, open the code and
synthetic data, and run it with Stata or R. Adapt to your local data by cleaning
and formatting your data to match the analysis specifications, and use the web
guide as a resource while you code." started =
"https://opensdp.github.io/analysis" %}

{% include link_box.html heading = "Improve Existing Analyses" content = "We
encourage you to modify, break and add to the code we’ve released thus far.
Visit OpenSDP on GitHub, choose and clone your repository of interest, modify or
add to it, and then send us a pull request to update the main branch of the
particular OpenSDP repository." started = "https://github.com/OpenSDP" %}
