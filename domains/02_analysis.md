description: Repositories of code and guidance to answer key questions in important education domains.
---
SDP and user-contributed analyses are housed in repositories on Github. Each
topic-based repository includes web guides with code and supports in Stata or R.
The Stata and R guides below are based on the
[Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use),
modified to work
with OpenSDP synthetic data. The synthetic data for the College-Going Pathways
guides is generated by the OpenSDP simulation engine, while some of the Human
Capital Analysis guides use a synthetic dataset developed using the machine
learning package
[synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html). The
guides and code will also work with college-going or human capital analysis
files prepared to the SDP Toolkit data specification.
