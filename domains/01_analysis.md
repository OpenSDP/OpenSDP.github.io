description: Repositories of code and guidance to answer key questions in important education domains.

SDP and user-contributed analyses are housed in repositories on Github. Each topic-based repository includes web guides with code and supports in Stata or R. The Stata and R guides below are based on the [Strategic Data Project Toolkit for Effective Data Use](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/toolkit-effective-data-use), modified to work with OpenSDP synthetic data. The synthetic data for the College-Going Pathways guides is generated by the OpenSDP simulation engine, while the Human Capital Analysis guides use a synthetic dataset developed from real data using the machine learning package [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html). The guides and code will also work with college-going or human capital analysis files prepared to the [SDP data specification]({{ "/assets/images/sdp_college_going_analysis_file_data_specification.pdf" | relative_url }}).
