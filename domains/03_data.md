<strong> How can we collaborate on education analytics when we work in closed data environments?</strong>

An open-source community for education data analysts seems like an oxymoron
because most of the student-level data that we work with is private, and data
formats are specific to agencies. We hope that we can tackle these two problems
by drawing on the OpenSDP community for help making realistic synthetic data
that can be used to develop, share, and present analyses, and embracing data
standards whenever possible.

The repositories below show OpenSDP's preliminary attempts to tackle the
synthetic data challenge. We encourage you to explore the open-source data
engine and the Faketucky and Fake County synthetic datasets. We also encourage
you to use publicly available data. Contact OpenSDP
at [{{ site.email}}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) to discuss ways to contribute to
the evolution of open-source synthetic data.
