The Strategic Data Project is a network of talented data strategists, researchers, and  leaders working across the country to use data to improve education. An initiative of the [Center for Education Policy Research at Harvard](https://cepr.harvard.edu), SDP has a long history of making analytic tools freely available for education data analysts. Our vision is to “transform the use of data in education to improve student achievement,” and there is no faster way to do that than to make a space available for others to share freely too.

SDP recruits, trains and supports data leaders in school systems across the country through its fellowship program and multiple training opportunities. Learn more at [sdp.cepr.harvard.edu](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu).
