#### Beating the Odds

School leaders often want to identify promising practices that distinguish high-performing schools from their counterparts and facilitate the transfer of some of these practices to struggling schools. A BTO analysis is one approach school leaders can take to identify schools that perform better or worse than expected, given the unique student populations they serve. In general, BTO analyses predict school performance based on the demographic make up of schoolsâ€™ student populations and then compare these predictions with actual school performance.

#### Similar Schools

Identify schools that are similar to each other in terms of student enrollment, faculty and staff characteristics, programs, spending and funding, and other school indicators that are publicly available on state and district report cards. Using data from the Kentucky school report card, this guide shows how unsupervised machine learning methods can be applied to publicly available data to gain insights into schools and districts across a state.
