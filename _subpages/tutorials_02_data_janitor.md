### Data Janitor
As most data analysts know, 80% of the job is getting raw data ready for analysis. Each new dataset is a fresh challenge, but fortunately there are best practices and useful programming skills specific to education data. The goal of the Data Janitor tutorial series is to speed up the learning curve for education analysts struggling with data cleaning chores.
